# danddslay ✨📖

A cozy, personal diary website built for two best friends — **Jimli** and **Arshita** — to write and read each other’s thoughts. This simple web app lets each person view their own diary, add entries with timestamps, and reflect on shared memories 💛

- 📝 Add new diary entries through a form
- 🕒 Each entry automatically displays the **day and date**
- 🔝 Entries appear in reverse-chronological order (latest first)
